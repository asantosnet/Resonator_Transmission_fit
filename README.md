# Resonator_Transmission_fit


The objective of this program was to allow for one to easily fit the transmission trough a transmission line connected to a resonator. 

Most of the functions are concerned with reading the data and with the GUI. On fits21ResoTiN_Assymetric.m one can see the equation used for the fitting.
